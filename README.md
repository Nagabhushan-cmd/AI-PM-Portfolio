## 🎯 The Problem

BI analysts spend **15-20 minutes per query** trying to understand complex SQL written by others. Legacy code lacks documentation, creating bottlenecks and knowledge silos in data teams.

**Impact:** 2-3 hours daily wasted per analyst on query comprehension alone.

---

## 💡 The Solution

An AI assistant that instantly provides:

- **Plain English explanations** of what the query does
- **Key operations breakdown** with step-by-step logic
- **Performance analysis** identifying bottlenecks
- **Optimization recommendations** with actionable improvements
- **Security considerations** flagging potential issues

**Time saved:** 87% reduction (15 min → 2 min per query)

## 🎬 Demo Example

**Input:**

```sql
SELECT c.name, COUNT(o.id) as orders, SUM(o.amount) as revenue
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.created_at >= '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY c.id
HAVING COUNT(o.id) > 5
ORDER BY revenue DESC
LIMIT 10
```

**AI Output:**

- Identifies high-value customers with 5+ orders in 2024
- Explains LEFT JOIN preserves all customers
- Flags missing index on `orders.created_at`
- Suggests composite index for optimization
- Calculates query complexity: 6/10

## 🗺️ Roadmap

**V2 (Week 2):**

- Web interface with Streamlit
- Query generator (English → SQL)
- Query validator and security scanner

**V3 (Month 2):**

- Database connections (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- Team collaboration features
- Export to PDF/Markdown

**V4 (Future):**

- IDE integrations (VS Code, JetBrains)

---

## 🧠 Product Decisions

**Why CLI first?**

- Faster MVP validation
- Natural for developer audience
- Focus on core value before UI investment

**Why Groq over OpenAI/Claude?**

- Free tier vs $0.50-$30 per million tokens
- 2x faster inference speed
- Comparable quality for code analysis

**Key Learning:**
Built for personal pain point = authentic understanding. Tested with 5 BI analysts before launch.
